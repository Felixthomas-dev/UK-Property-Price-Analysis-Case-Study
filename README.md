## Problem Overview
The HM Land Registry, a non-ministerial department responsible for registering land and property ownership in England and Wales, oversees property transactions valued at over Â£8 trillion. In a bid to optimize operations, insights and trends within the property market need to be identified. This project aims to analyze property sales data from 2021 to 2023, to uncover these insights and predict future market trends. A dashboard has been created to present the findings and forecasts.

The dataset comprises the following fields:

- **Price**: The sale price as stated on the transfer deed.
- **Date_of_Transfer**: The completion date of the sale.
- **Postcode**: The postal code of the property.
- **Property_Type**: Categorized into Detached (D), Semi-Detached (S), Terraced (T), Flats/Maisonettes (F), or Other (O).
- **Old/New**: Indicates the age of the property; 'Y' for newly built, 'N' for older properties.
- **PAON (Primary Addressable Object Name)**: The house number or name.

## Note on the Dataset
The data analyzed in this case study is based on synthesized property sales records. It has been designed to mimic real transactions for the purpose of this analysis but does not reflect actual market data. This synthetic dataset was used to ensure privacy and confidentiality, allowing for the demonstration of data analysis and forecasting techniques without compromising real-world data integrity.
